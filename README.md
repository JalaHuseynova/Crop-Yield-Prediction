🌾 Crop yield prediction with weather data
📌 Overview

An end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project that analyzes historical crop yield data across multiple countries and predicts future agricultural productivity based on weather conditions obtained from an external API.

The project explores how climate factors influence crop yield and presents insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

🎯 Key goals
